# Air Traffic Simulation and Analysis in Colombia

## Project Overview

Given the continuous flow of people traveling in and out of Colombia, as well as between different cities within the country, there is a growing need to maintain accurate and up-to-date information on flights. This information is crucial not only for travelers planning their journeys but also for airport authorities, airlines, and other entities related to the aviation industry.

Air transport plays a fundamental role in the country's connectivity, facilitating tourism, commerce, and other important aspects of economic and social life. To keep citizens informed and ensure efficient management of airport infrastructure, it is necessary to collect data on flights operating in Colombia.

## Project Objective

In this project, we aim to use data collected by the Civil Aeronautics of Colombia in 2022 on commercial, cargo, private, and military flights to develop a solution that simulates the behavior of air traffic in Colombia. This solution will enable us to analyze, identify, and make decisions regarding air traffic and the air communication network in Colombia.

## Data Sources

The data were obtained from the Open Data platform and published by the Civil Aeronautics of Colombia. For the development of this project, we will use two different data sources, which we will extend to cover various aspects of air traffic simulation and analysis.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Collection and Processing**:
    - Read and process airport and flight data from CSV files.
    - Build graph structures representing the air traffic network.

2. **Graph Construction**:
    - Create directed and undirected graphs for commercial, military, cargo, and general aviation flights.

3. **Analysis and Simulation**:
    - Implement algorithms to find the most connected airports.
    - Calculate shortest paths and minimum spanning trees.
    - Simulate and visualize air traffic behavior.

4. **Visualization and Reporting**:
    - Generate reports and visualizations to help understand air traffic patterns and network connectivity.
